The skilled [[craftsman]] had a [[forgiving]] nature despite his [[methodological]] approach to work, believing his colleague's [[delusion]] about the [[hideous]] sculpture was merely the perspective of an [[aspiring]] artist who remained [[mute]] on matters of human [[physiology]], causing the mentor to [[chuckle]] softly. Critics would [[ascribe]] the artwork's poor reception to factors that would [[dampen]] enthusiasm, while a notorious art [[trafficker]] attempted to [[rouse]] students living in the university [[dormitory]], creating a legal [[hassle]] that questioned his [[sincerity]]. The sculptor's [[quirky]] installation contained traces of [[plutonium]], leaving officials [[stricken]] with concern despite the artist's [[professionalism]], forcing security to [[eject]] him for [[unauthorized]] modifications after he [[flatly]] denied wrongdoing. The museum director helped [[marshal]] resources despite [[staffing]] shortages, planning to [[remarry]] her ex-husband who would [[stipulate]] in their prenuptial agreement that serving [[oatmeal]] to guests or allowing staff to [[shred]] important documents would constitute grounds for divorce. The gallery's refreshment table offered [[watermelon]] slices while visitors discussed allegations of [[adultery]] that had cost the [[first-class]] artist his reputation, creating [[undesirable]] publicity that forced him to withdraw cash from an [[ATM]] to address legal fees. The museum board examined every [[angle]] of the [[escalating]] scandal, navigating the [[treacherous]] public relations nightmare while the construction [[foreman]] delivered a [[memorandum]] about gallery [[fragmentation]] that [[changed]] the renovation schedule. With [[moderation]], the curator extended an [[outstretched]] hand toward reconciliation, glancing in her [[rearview]] mirror as she drove past landscapers spreading [[mulch]] around the [[mythical]] creature statues, hiring a professional [[mover]] with [[far-reaching]] industry connections. The solution seemed [[fitting]] as the perfect [[embodiment]] of compromise, though the director's [[leukemia]] diagnosis and [[dwindling]] energy made her increasingly sensitive to [[intrusive]] questions from reporters who spoke [[confidently]] about matters they were [[infinitely]] unqualified to address. The museum remained a cultural [[powerhouse]] with the controversial artist as the [[front-runner]] for the annual award, his work [[syndicated]] across national publications with an [[overdue]] recognition of his talent despite [[metabolic]] issues that kept him resting [[upstairs]] where water would [[drip]] from the ceiling. With a [[flick]] of his wrist, he dismissed concerns about his [[shabby]] apartment, [[determining]] that an extensive [[overhaul]] of his living conditions could wait while the committee greeted him [[warmly]] at the ceremony honoring an [[unnamed]] contributor. The feeding [[trough]] of publicity allowed him to [[vent]] frustrations he would [[gladly]] bring [[up]] during interviews about his [[prolific]] career, avoiding [[generalized]] statements while gesturing [[upwards]] toward his masterpiece. His business [[partner]] worked to prevent critics from trying to [[marginalize]] his contributions, staying [[busy]] with a schedule [[telling]] of his importance in the art world. The sculpture's slight [[tilt]] conveyed a strange [[tenderness]] that challenged visitors' [[cognition]], its [[beige]] background contrasting with bold strokes reminiscent of [[Nigerian]] tribal art. A museum [[sidebar]] exhibition created an environment [[conducive]] to appreciation despite [[defective]] lighting that made the [[mammoth]] installation appear more [[predatory]] than intended. The museum [[treasurer]] moved to [[disable]] audio guides that made [[reference]] to controversial techniques, refusing to [[censor]] the [[ludicrous]] claims about the artist's [[articulation]] of themes that were [[chiefly]] focused on achieving [[optimum]] emotional impact. The state [[treasury]] provided funds for security [[trappings]] after someone left a decorative [[dagger]] near the controversial exhibit as a form of protest.
