The dentist discovered a [[cavity]] seemingly [[unrelated]] to my earlier complaints, a [[troubling]] development for a [[novice]] patient like myself; special dental [[glue]] would be required, the doctor explained through an educational [[animation]] that followed the treatment [[blueprint]] exactly to the [[tenth]] detail to prevent [[catastrophic]] complications. The office's [[black-and-white]] photographs earned my [[compliment]], as I secretly [[crave]] a more artful environment when feeling like a nervous [[pedestrian]] about to be hit by the truck of dental pain; a [[nude]] sculpture in the waiting area distracted me from thoughts about [[hiring]] a different specialist after noticing medicine [[residue]] on tools, though the clear [[progression]] of my treatment helped the doctor [[whip]] my dental health into shape. The [[impact]] of sugary drinks and chemical [[runoff]] from factories could [[shorten]] tooth lifespan, causing unnecessary [[agony]] for patients who must [[accustom]] themselves to proper care before teeth [[deteriorate]] beyond repair; the [[professionally]] trained staff showed [[empathy]] when my appointment [[collide]]d with another meeting, finding common [[ground]] during [[bargaining]] for a new time that seemed [[feasible]] under office policies. The new dental guidelines were [[applicable]] to all patients, much like an [[impeachment]] proceeding follows strict rules, demonstrating the doctor's [[mastery]] of the clinical [[structure]] designed by a medical [[playwright]] whose [[directive]]s allowed dentists to [[bypass]] traditional methods and [[reap]] better results. The modern office [[facade]] [[underlie]] deeper technological advances, though the [[arrogant]] receptionist needed to [[vent]] her frustrations elsewhere; I sat on the [[edge]] of my seat with [[dubious]] faith in [[preventive]] treatments, despite the [[creamy]] medication that the doctor could not [[foresee]] would stain my favorite [[sport]]s shirt. The [[intent]] to improve [[oneself]] through dental hygiene requires patients to [[wade]] through conflicting advice about [[enhanced]] treatments not covered by insurance within my tax [[bracket]], while office assistants dusted surfaces to remove any [[dust]] that might seem [[harmless]] but could contaminate equipment during [[loading]] procedures. Through the window, I watched someone using [[binoculars]] to birdwatch, my attention wandering as a woman adjusted her [[bra]] strap in her car; the dental [[paste]] applied by the [[premier]] specialist helped avoid further [[peril]] to my oral health, which would [[eclipse]] all other medical concerns if left untreated. The bathroom [[mirror]] revealed my anxious expression at the [[peak]] of my appointment, reminiscent of [[nineteenth-century]] dental procedures I'd read about in a [[Mediterranean]] travel guide in the waiting room; despite everything, I found [[enjoyment]] in the knowledge that the doctor's [[reign]] over my treatment would end soon, unlike those [[convicted]] of crimes whose punishments [[affect]] them for years. The doctor [[rightly]] displayed [[patriotic]] decorations in the office where my dental [[bruise]] would eventually heal; an [[advertiser]] for [[poultry]] products interrupted the waiting room television as security [[patrol]]led the building, making me wonder if the [[heterosexual]] doctor would [[rewrite]] my treatment plan. A [[Protestant]] pamphlet in the waiting room discussed moral decay under [[dictatorship]]s while a toy boat seemed to [[sail]] across the aquarium; I suppressed a [[moan]] as the dental [[procession]] of hygienists entered the room saying "[[em]], this looks interesting." A magazine featured an article about an [[automaker]]'s new vehicles as I nervously ate a [[cracker]] before my appointment; a rerun of a popular [[sitcom]] played on the television, helping to [[lessen]] my anxiety about the procedure that, according to recent [[genetics]] research, might be more painful for me than others. The Spanish [[conquest]] documentary playing in the background made me whisper "[[gosh]]" at the historical brutality, wondering about the [[payoff]] of watching such content before a potentially painful appointment; a [[Lebanese]] dental expert quoted in a [[parliamentary]] hearing advocated for [[amateur]] dentists to receive better training rather than [[perpetuate]] outdated techniques that were once considered [[fashionable]]. The [[Methodist]] church across the street was visible from the dental chair, its flyer about proper [[packaging]] of donated items visible on the community board near the safety [[railing]] in the hallway.
