[[Supposedly]], the architect [[added]] features that the [[builder]] originally rejected, giving us a [[glimpse]] into the controversial [[premise]] of urban renewal—his [[specialty]] was transforming spaces [[deem]]ed worthless into community treasures, preserving every historical [[artifact]] despite attempts to [[sneak]] in modern elements that the playful [[monkey]] mural represented. My [[mentor]] explained that [[two-thirds]] of every city budget should serve the [[listener]]'s community needs; like [[lightning]], inspiration struck him [[legally]] binding plans appeared from his [[sleeve]] despite his apparent [[disappointment]] when regulations would [[disturb]] his vision—he once joked that city planning gave him a pain in his [[rib]] from [[excessive]] laughter. The [[high-tech]] solutions often created [[debris]] that would [[pile]] up metaphorically like an iron [[rod]] through the heart of his [[logical]] approach; being [[liberal]] with creative freedoms yet careful not to let his ideas turn to [[ash]], he remained [[socially]] conscious about each [[parish]] neighborhood's history, acknowledging past [[slavery]] without leaving emotional spaces [[blank]]. He viewed housing not as a [[commodity]] but as a potential [[cure]] for community division, incorporating local [[mineral]] resources to address the [[hunger]] for belonging among the [[dying]] industrial sectors, focusing on [[developmental]] strategies that moved [[faster]] than bureaucracy typically allowed. With no [[spare]] time, and only [[halfway]] toward finding a permanent [[cure]] for urban inequity, his commitment to [[equality]] meant never building over a [[cemetery]] or allowing [[harassment]] of displaced residents; he [[deliberately]] avoided [[fame]] despite his achievements, expressing [[regret]] only when making [[striking]] compromises that increased the [[likelihood]] of project approval. He once compared urban planning to cultivating a [[carrot]], requiring patience; standing [[atop]] his latest development, he contemplated the emotional [[toll]] of gentrification from the building's [[rim]], feeling [[embarrassed]] by praise yet "[[fucking]] brilliant" was how colleagues described his work as locals [[cling]] to their increasingly valuable yet [[isolated]] communities. In the [[blink]] of an eye, formerly [[suspicious]] residents—even those using a [[wheelchair]]—joined his planning [[squad]] because they were [[eligible]] for affordable housing; his mental [[processor]] worked overtime before every project [[plunge]], making "[[this]] neighborhood sustainable" his motto. Each corporate [[sponsor]] would [[grin]] at the diversity represented through [[color]] choices reflecting the [[demographic]] reality of residents; when [[rain]] threatened construction, a metaphorical [[chill]] ran through investors seeking [[refuge]] in contractual clauses as he tried to [[steer]] the project toward completion. The [[legislator]] attending the opening [[rally]] praised the [[programming]] of community spaces designed to inspire [[cheer]]; each retail [[outlet]] remained financially [[intact]] while local [[vendor]]s could [[thrive]] like [[peanut]] plants in fertile soil. Residents could [[chew]] on the [[elaborate]] ideas presented in [[intellectual]] gathering spaces where the very [[conception]] of community was reimagined; the housing rights [[auction]] generated funds while residents enjoyed a celebratory [[steak]] dinner, learning how to [[comply]] with new regulations—a [[triumph]] of planning that satisfied every [[shareholder]] with [[comparable]] returns. The [[transport]] options eased his [[conscience]] despite complicated financial [[calculation]]s that [[considerably]] reduced profit margins; at regular [[interval]]s he would [[scratch]] out inefficiencies, staying [[awake]] through challenges, always respecting the legal [[jurisdiction]] of local authorities.
