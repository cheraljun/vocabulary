It's [[only]] natural that [[those]] experiences [[tell]] a story about who we are. [[one]] teacher made a [[very]] important point to [[her]] class: [[even]] when you face setbacks, you can always come [[back]] stronger than before. [[any]] [[good]] [[woman]] or man who goes [[through]] difficult times will tell [[us]] that [[life]] is not measured by achievements alone. As a [[child]], [[there]] were moments when I didn't understand how [[work]] could bring joy, but looking [[down]] at my completed projects, I realized I [[may]] have been wrong. [[after]] graduation, you [[should]] [[call]] your mentors who helped you understand the [[world]] [[over]] the years. My high [[school]] memories [[still]] inspire me to [[try]] harder [[in]] everything I do, [[as]] the [[last]] lessons often matter most. Don't be afraid to [[ask]] for what you [[need]] when things become [[too]] overwhelming—it's okay to [[feel]] uncertain. The [[three]] friends met [[when]] the emotional [[state]] of our country was at its worst, yet they [[never]] stopped believing they could [[become]] a bridge [[between]] communities. The [[high]] expectations [[really]] pushed them to create [[something]] meaningful that [[most]] people wouldn't attempt. [[another]] day brought [[much]] clarity to the [[family]] situation, helping them [[own]] their mistakes and speak [[out]] about their experiences. Some people [[leave]] everything behind to [[put]] themselves in challenging situations, while [[old]] traditions fade away. [[while]] this might [[mean]] giving up security, the focus remains [[on]] growth. We must [[keep]] encouraging every [[student]] to question [[why]] certain systems exist and [[let]] them discover [[great]] solutions. The [[same]] [[big]] [[group]] will [[begin]] to [[seem]] divided when a [[country]] doesn't [[help]] citizens [[talk]] about [[where]] to [[turn]] when facing a [[problem]]. [[every]] morning, we [[start]] with a fresh [[hand]] dealt to us—we [[might]] not control the cards, but our response matters. [[American]] history [[show]]s that taking [[part]] in civic discussions [[about]] standing [[against]] injustice has always created a [[place]] for progress. [[over]] time, [[such]] movements have [[again]] proven that even a [[few]] dedicated people can change the [[case]] for [[most]] marginalized communities. Last [[week]], our [[company]] discussed [[where]] our [[system]] stands and how [[each]] person has the [[right]] to contribute to the [[program]]. If you [[hear]] someone speaking up, [[so]] listen to their [[question]] carefully. [[during]] difficult times, our [[work]] and [[play]] balance becomes essential for maintaining perspective.
