The restaurant wasn't doing well [[commercially]] and was operating at a loss, [[minus]] its previous profits, according to an [[eyewitness]] who had tracked the declining customer [[number]] over months, questioning the owner's [[decision-making]] process that ignored staff [[grievance]]s until several employees contracted [[pneumonia]] due to workplace [[brutality]] that included being forced to clean air [[duct]]s without proper equipment—about [[three-quarters]] of the original staff had quit. The story would make a compelling [[thriller]] novel, reducing fine dining to [[pulp]] fiction featuring [[stuffed]] animals as characters that appealed more to children than [[grown-up]]s, though the owner continued to [[woo]] investors despite visible stress that flared his [[nostril]]s as he maintained a tight grip on the [[helm]] of his business, behaving like a [[monarch]] watching his kingdom crumble while profits [[seep]]ed away; I noticed his [[eyelid]] twitching nervously as he would [[cradle]] expensive bottles of wine, growing increasingly [[paranoid]] about competitors. The former boxing [[champion]] turned restaurateur had secured [[lending]] from banks by promoting his [[uniquely]] spiced [[curry]] dishes that would [[raise]] concerns among health inspectors about possible [[pathogen]]s, especially after the volcanic [[eruption]] nearby caused ash to contaminate ingredients; angry customers would [[stomp]] out upon discovering a [[crook]]ed business practice that even the park [[ranger]] who frequented the place couldn't ignore, scratching his [[scalp]] in disbelief. Those who still [[cherish]]ed the establishment would [[relish]] its signature dishes—"[[thou]] shalt try the special," the waiters would insist—served in a [[spacious]] dining room where managers would [[crank]] up air conditioning to uncomfortable levels, a form of customer [[censorship]] that helped [[unravel]] the mystery of how they [[smuggle]]d exotic ingredients across borders. The restaurant was [[bound]] to fail, leaving customers [[annoyed]] by service that wasn't worth a [[mint]], though the [[soothing]] background music had become [[commonplace]] in upscale establishments, often used to [[mislead]] diners about wait times until [[dawn]] when the last patrons would [[dip]] their bread in olive oil while listening to the owner's [[persuasive]] arguments about charging [[premium]] prices. The [[classified]] information about food sources was, [[incidentally]], part of the owner's [[PhD]] research on consumer psychology, causing food critics to [[mock]] his approach to [[deregulation]] of restaurant standards and make sweeping [[generalization]]s about the industry during economic [[contraction]]; meanwhile, [[avid]] food bloggers explored the restaurant's inspiration from Greek [[mythology]], noting how flavors seemed to [[emanate]] from the kitchen where the chef would [[stalk]] from station to station ensuring quality. The view of [[farmland]] surrounding the [[municipality]] provided a distraction from [[boredom]] while waiting for service, though setting [[unrealistic]] expectations based on the [[Latin]] menu with deliberately [[inaccurate]] translations; special events would [[commemorate]] the chef's heritage, where the restaurant owner would [[groom]] young chefs before the ritual [[slaughter]] of premium meats in a kitchen often criticized for [[filthy]] conditions. The health department would repeatedly [[defer]] inspections of this [[exceptionally]] popular venue despite [[rampant]] violations, including imported [[chile]] peppers that supposedly [[outweigh]]ed health concerns; the owner's children were cared for by a [[nanny]] wearing [[stylish]] uniforms who made an [[abrupt]] exit after learning about the restaurant's [[demographics]] research conducted in the [[terminal]] illness ward of a hospital. The [[simultaneous]] publication of exposés in several [[tabloid]] magazines and a [[Baptist]] church newsletter revealed the [[nonexistent]] health standards, destroying any sense of [[fulfillment]] the owner derived from a business model inspired by culinary [[antiquity]], while the identified [[attacker]] of food safety became famous; loyal customers would [[nestle]] into corner booths for a final [[glimpse]] of the establishment before it would [[veer]] into bankruptcy—the [[downside]] of fame being the [[utter]] destruction of reputation. A [[Cuban]] chef formerly employed there started an [[automotive]] repair shop that was doing [[amazingly]] well, keeping menus as souvenirs to [[shred]] during celebrations where the sound of [[gunfire]] from nearby military exercises provided a strangely [[refreshing]] reminder of their escape from culinary exploitation.
