The energy [[level]] in the laboratory dropped when Professor Wilson tried to [[screw]] the lid back on a jar containing a sample that emitted unusual [[warmth]]; his [[undergraduate]] assistant spilled the mysterious [[liquid]] on his notes, causing an immediate [[headache]] that prompted a call to the campus [[policeman]] about potential chemical exposure—this year's research would [[yield]] lower [[projection]]s than expected in our [[battle]] against climate change. Finding a [[suitable]] replacement wouldn't be easy; I should [[mention]] that after [[graduation]], every lab member must complete safety [[drill]]s to prevent such [[cruel]] accidents. Back at his [[mansion]], the professor could only [[regard]] his withered [[grape]]vine while waiting for officials to [[authorize]] his return to work; meanwhile, I stayed at my [[cottage]] down a long [[driveway]], admiring the [[charm]] of rural living while writing my thesis on plant [[sexuality]] with my [[loyal]] research dog sleeping on [[clay]] tiles. The professor would [[pound]] his desk in frustration, watching his helium [[balloon]] experiment—an [[invention]] that could deflate his academic [[ego]] if unsuccessful—wondering how much taxi [[fare]] to pay for retrieving his [[homework]] and research [[disc]] he'd left on the [[sofa]] at the lab. I couldn't [[guarantee]] the [[availability]] of new equipment; our funding depended on [[radar]] technology applications, and the department chair would [[frown]] intensely until we could [[regain]] our reputation—she wouldn't [[leave]] without a [[permit]] for our revised experiments. Wearing a thick [[sweater]] during his [[rehabilitation]], the professor discussed [[rubber]] compounds while on [[retreat]] at the conference about atomic [[molecule]]s where scientists could speak [[freely]] about their work; under [[favorable]] conditions, our research progressed [[steadily]] as our [[veteran]] team [[integrated]] new safety protocols. "[[Ha]]!" laughed the bright [[youngster]] who would later [[broadcast]] our findings on the [[premium]] research channel where [[accountability]] was paramount, though the complexity might [[overwhelm]] viewers when explaining how [[one-third]] of our samples deteriorated. I would [[contemplate]] the need to [[update]] our methods to [[spark]] interest; [[ironically]], researcher [[fatigue]] pushed us [[beyond]] what we thought possible, making critics [[speculate]] about our methods. Using a permanent [[marker]], I labeled containers with [[low]] identification numbers, careful not to [[preach]] about proper technique while carrying a [[bucket]] of samples that could metaphorically [[bomb]] our career if mishandled; the [[blond]] lab manager's [[confession]] about altered data would [[provoke]] serious consequences. The [[marble]] countertops were damaged [[substantially]] by chemical exposure that would [[twist]] the department's budget; our legal [[defender]] argued that the [[fish]] in our ecosystem study showed [[explicit]] reactions when we attempted to [[transport]] them—a [[disturbing]] discovery that justified increased [[surveillance]] of environmental changes. The [[magnetic]] field disruption required a specialized [[technician]] who would [[mutter]] instructions while repairing equipment after the [[devastating]] power surge; we would [[depart]] following the [[arrow]] signs indicating emergency exits, carrying the psychological [[trauma]] of possible research failure. Our [[neighboring]] lab offered to let us [[soak]] our damaged equipment in neutralizing solution; a safety award [[ribbon]] hung in the [[meantime]] as we worked to [[transmit]] data to the main [[screen]]. The fall [[harvest]] season brought [[consecutive]] storms that challenged our outdoor experiments; the [[republican]] senator who helped [[coordinate]] funding visits learned of our [[worldwide]] reputation for conducting ethical research [[within]] strict guidelines.
