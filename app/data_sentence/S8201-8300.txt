On a [[cooler]] evening after a refreshing [[swim]], I felt [[blessed]] to [[delete]] the stressful memories and watch the sunset [[flicker]] across the lake, though I knew I might [[incur]] some debt from this [[glamorous]] vacation about which I couldn't help but [[brag]] to my friends in [[successive]] emails, attaching photos of a small [[souvenir]] I bought—a decorative [[slate]] made by a local [[carpenter]] who used it as a [[benchmark]] for quality craftsmanship. Feeling [[exhausted]] yet comforted by the [[familiarity]] of my cabin, I walked across a wooden [[plank]] to sit beside the [[blaze]] of the campfire, embracing a moment of [[relaxation]] after a [[lousy]] day at work last week, grateful for this [[brand-new]] experience that improved my mood better than watching the [[GDP]] reports. I enjoyed some tea with a [[biscuit]] while thinking that, [[conversely]], staying home would have meant missing out; I had [[narrowly]] avoided canceling the trip after getting food poisoning from a [[tortilla]] wrap. As a devoted [[disciple]] of outdoor adventures, I responded [[angrily]] when my friend, a [[vet]] with concerns about potential [[backlash]] from ignoring my [[physiological]] needs for rest, suggested I should stay home; instead, I visited a nearby [[monastery]] and a quaint [[bakery]] without [[hesitation]]. Driving back with one [[headlight]] barely working, I passed a business [[consortium]]'s headquarters, still wearing my cooking [[apron]] when suddenly a clap of [[thunder]] startled me, reminding me of my days as an [[intern]] at a weather station where I had made a [[vow]] never to let [[nostalgia]] prevent me from being [[independent]]. This experience didn't [[preclude]] me from stopping to clean up some [[litter]] on the roadside, where I met a recently [[divorced]] photographer capturing an [[exquisite]] [[waterfall]] in the distance, and we discussed his [[initiation]] into landscape photography after working as a military [[sniper]], then developing an [[automated]] system for nature photography. He handed me a letter starting with "[[dear]] friend" that described his struggle with the [[uneven]] terrain, hiking [[without]] proper equipment, getting [[infected]] with poison ivy, and still pursuing his passion in [[accordance]] with his life goals. Once a [[bodyguard]] for celebrities, he loved using Latin phrases like "[[sic]]" in his writings, and offered to [[swap]] photography tips if I would [[immerse]] myself in the craft; he even shared a story about a [[coyote]] with an impressive [[mustache]]-like marking that he [[consciously]] tracked, unlike the [[thug]] who once tried to steal his camera. We went to a restaurant to [[fry]] some fish at a downtown [[plaza]], but a [[misunderstanding]] with the waiter triggered my [[jealousy]] when he gave the last table to a military [[cadet]], forcing us to [[freeze]] our plans despite the [[aura]] of excitement around us; we then discussed the impact of [[petroleum]] prices during our [[face-to-face]] conversation while watching birds [[flap]] their wings overhead. After my [[submission]] of a complaint, the restaurant agreed to [[preheat]] a special dish for us, which somewhat salvaged our [[honeymoon]]-like evening despite the [[drastic]] service issues; we bid [[farewell]] to the [[chilling]] atmosphere of that establishment, discussing the [[competitiveness]] of local restaurants and showing our [[patriotism]] by choosing one with [[striped]] flags at the entrance. The [[advent]] of better dining options saved us from further [[disciplinary]] action against the restaurant, helping me [[crush]] my [[woe]] as I watched the [[ripple]] effect of our complaint address the service [[imbalance]]; later, I learned how to [[sauté]] vegetables [[moderately]] well, acknowledging my [[shortcoming]] in culinary skills. Playing [[poker]] [[indoors]] during the [[eighteenth]] hour of our trip, I noticed a [[seam]] coming loose on my jacket and made plans to [[restructure]] my vacation time to include shopping; I bought a [[cookbook]] that addressed my [[longing]] for homemade meals and a [[booster]] for my cell phone signal to stay connected with home. The restaurant featured [[carved]] wooden decorations and employed a famous [[broadcaster]] who had retired to pursue culinary arts.
